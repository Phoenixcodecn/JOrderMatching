# JOrderMatching
Prototype of Order Matching Engine with Basic FIX Gateway using Java

This is a prototype project extracted from my Msc dissertation project "High-throughput And Low-latency Trading System using Java" in HKU.

Only JDK 1.8 is required to run the main project. <b>No third party library is needed.</b>
